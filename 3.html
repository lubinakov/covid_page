        Not all the days are perfect. Au contraire, some days we feel stressed, in pain, unhappy, nervous … Just name it. If I am at home or have enough time, it’s easy to cope with it. I simply start doing something what I like and by changing my focus I switch my mood pretty quickly. I read a book, watch something interesting on YouTube, dance, draw, call somebody, meditate … There are many ways how to deal with it. The situation gets complicated when I am somewhere else, people are around or I don’t have enough time. For such occasions, I use “4-4-4-4 breathing” technique. It’s one of yoga’s pranayama (practice of breath control) methods with many positive side effects on your mind & body. For me personally, this technique serves me as one of the fastest “hacks” to switch my mood or to alleviate a pain. It works miraculously. And you can do it anywhere without anybody even noticing ;). You JUST need to BREATHE for couple of minutes with your FULL FOCUS ON YOUR BREATH. Here is how to do it:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. While inhaling count to 4 or say an affirmation which suits you the best at the moment. For example, I use “My body is healthy and strong” or “My life is beautiful”.<br>
        2. Hold your breath for 4 counts (or in your mind repeat an affirmation you have chosen)<br>
        3. Exhale while counting to 4 or repeat the affirmation<br>
        4. Hold the breathe for 4 counts or repeat your affirmation
    </p>
    <p>
        I usually use one affirmation for inhale and exhale and a different one while I am holding my breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is what works perfectly for pain relief:
    </p>
    <p>
        “With each inhale I am breathing in a healing energy” and alternatively “With each exhale I am releasing all the pain”. Anyhow, it’s up to you. Play with it, feel free to experiment and decide what suits you the most.
    </p>

        Happy breathing :)
